                <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
                   <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                    this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                    background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</p>

                    a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                    adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</p>

                        the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
                        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                        assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                        whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                        from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                        field may be required to play all their games away.</p>

                        fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged

                        injuries.</p>
